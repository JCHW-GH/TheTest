# TheTest

A test for the people, for me.

Well, it's that time of year again â€” the time when I think I'll start coding.
In the past, I got overwhelmed chasing too many squirrels, which led to getting nothing done.

But this time will be different.
I will code that Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
I will make the app Iâ€™ve been envisioning â€” right after I build the extensions Iâ€™ve dreamed up.

And you?
Youâ€™ll see it all â€” the highs, the lows, the joyful chuckles at the woes of an overconfident noob.

2025... Let's GOOOO! ðŸ˜„
